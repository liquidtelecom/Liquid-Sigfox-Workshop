# MKRFOX 1200 - Retrieve board informations

Use this sketch to retrieve your Arduino [MKRFOX](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main.ArduinoBoardMKRFox1200) board ID & PAC, to register online in 3 minutes through the Sigfox DevKit [onboarding platform](http://backend.sigfox.com/activate/arduino).

This sketch does not send any message over the Sigfox network. It only retrieves identity information from the ATA8520 chipset.

⚠️ The PAC provided by the board is the factory value. It's a throw-away value and can only be used once, for initial registration.
